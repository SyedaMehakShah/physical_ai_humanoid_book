# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Bridging the Digital Brain and the Physical Body

## Welcome to Physical AI

This book is designed for students who have completed earlier AI quarters (LLMs, agents, tools) and are familiar with Python and basic AI concepts. Our goal is to bridge your "digital AI" knowledge into the physical world using humanoid robots, guiding you from conceptual foundations to simulated and real humanoid control using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this curriculum, you will be able to:
- Understand how AI agents can control physical bodies in the real world
- Work with ROS 2 as the middleware connecting AI systems to physical robots
- Use digital twins in simulation environments to safely test robot behaviors
- Design robot behaviors as distributed systems
- Integrate AI agents with robotic systems for complex behaviors

### The Journey Ahead

This book is structured into five progressive modules:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn how ROS 2 acts as the communication backbone for robots
2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explore physics simulation and virtual environments
3. **NVIDIA Isaac & Advanced Simulation** - Advanced simulation techniques and AI integration
4. **From Simulation to Real Humanoids** - Transitioning from virtual to real-world robots
5. **Human-Robot Interaction & Safety** - Safe and effective human-robot collaboration

### Tools Overview

Throughout this book, you'll work with industry-standard tools:
- **ROS 2**: The Robot Operating System for middleware and communication
- **Gazebo**: Physics simulation for testing robot behaviors
- **Unity**: High-fidelity rendering for advanced visualization
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: Advanced simulation and AI integration platform
- **Python + rclpy**: Primary programming interface for ROS 2

### Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to understand the foundational concepts of robotic communication systems. Each module builds upon the previous one, following the pedagogy sequence: Intuition → Concept → Diagram → Minimal Example → Exercises.
