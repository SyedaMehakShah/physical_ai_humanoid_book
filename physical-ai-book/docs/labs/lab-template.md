# Lab Template

## Overview
This template provides a standardized format for laboratory exercises throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum. All lab exercises follow this structure to ensure consistency and maximize learning effectiveness.

## Lab Structure

### Pre-Lab Preparation
- **Estimated Time**: Time needed for setup and preparation
- **Prerequisites**: Knowledge or skills required before starting
- **Materials**: Software, hardware, or other resources needed
- **Objectives**: Clear learning outcomes you will achieve

### Lab Objectives
1. Specific learning outcome 1
2. Specific learning outcome 2
3. Specific learning outcome 3

### Background Theory
